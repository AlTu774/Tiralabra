### Progress Report 2:
I Looked more into different pathfinding algorithms to determine which I should use in this project and decided to go with Dijkstra and IDA*.
Since I should have made the decision last week to get it approved, I started working on the visualization of the algorithm in pygame first.

Time spent on project: 7h
